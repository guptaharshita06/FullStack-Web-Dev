 Day 1 Notes
============================================

Goal: Set up development environment and understand the basics of the MERN stack.

-----------------------------------------------------
üß† BASICS - Version Control, GitHub, README, Terminal
-----------------------------------------------------

1. What is Git?
- Git is a version control system.
- It tracks all changes in your code.
- You can go back to an older version if something breaks.

2. What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a website to store and share code online.
- It helps you work with a team using Git.

3. What is Version Control?
- A system to keep track of code changes.
- Allows multiple people to work on the same project.

4. What is a README.md file?
- A special file that describes your project.
- It is written in Markdown language.
- It usually contains:
  - Project name
  - Description
  - Features
  - Technologies used
  - How to install/run
  - Screenshots or links (optional)

5. What is Open Source?
- Open source means the source code is public.
- Anyone can use, modify, or contribute.
- Examples: Linux, Firefox, React, Python.

6. What is Terminal / CLI?
- CLI = Command Line Interface
- You type commands instead of clicking.
- Common commands:
  - cd (change directory)
  - ls (list files)
  - mkdir (make directory)
  - touch file.txt (create file)
  - git init, git add, git commit, git push (Git commands)

7. Markdown Syntax (used in README files):
  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  **Bold Text**
  *Italic Text*
  - Bullet List
  1. Numbered List

‚öôÔ∏è DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP & MERN BASICS
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Install Node.js and npm:
- Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server (backend).
- npm (Node Package Manager) helps us install libraries.
- Download from: https://nodejs.org/

2. Install MongoDB Community Edition:
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database. It stores data in JSON format.
- It is used to store the data of your app.
- Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

3. Install Visual Studio Code:
- VS Code is a code editor to write your code.
- It supports many languages and has great extensions.
- Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

4. Install Git and set up GitHub:
- Git is installed from: https://git-scm.com/
- Create GitHub account at: https://github.com/

5. Practice Git Commands:
- git init ‚Üí start a new git repository
- git add . ‚Üí add all files to staging
- git commit -m "message" ‚Üí save snapshot with a message
- git remote add origin <repo-url> ‚Üí link with GitHub
- git push -u origin main ‚Üí upload code to GitHub

6. Learn the MERN Stack:
- M = MongoDB ‚Üí stores data
- E = Express.js ‚Üí handles routes and APIs
- R = React.js ‚Üí builds the front-end (user interface)
- N = Node.js ‚Üí runs JavaScript backend code

7. Install Postman:
- Postman is used to test APIs (like login, register).
- You can send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
- Download from: https://www.postman.com/downloads
